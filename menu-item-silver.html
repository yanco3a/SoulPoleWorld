					<strong>Alcohol</strong>
					<p>For liability and legal purposes, we do not allow alcohol to be consumed during or prior to our parties. Please refrain from alcohol consumption,
						before your party and please do not attempt to consume any alcohol in or outside the premises. If we suspect a guest is under the influence of alcohol,
						we will ask that the guest be removed from the premises.</p>
					<strong>Age Limitations</strong>
					<p>If you are under the age of 18, we require parental consent. Your parent will need to come to the studio with you so that they can sign the
						release form with a copy of their ID. Admittance is at the discretion of the instructor.</p>
						<strong>Late Arrival or No-shows</strong>
						<p>We cannot extend party time due to late arrivals. Parties will start at the scheduled party time and no later. Please do your best to be on time
							for your party. You will not receive a refund for any guest who does not attend.</p>
					<strong>Reservationsï»¿</strong>
					<p>We offer parties between 4pm-8pm Saturdays. You can book up several weeks or even months in advance. Reservations are required
						 and are taken on a first-come, first-serve basis. We highly recommend booking your preferred date and time as soon as possible.

					<strong>Rescheduling/Reservation Changes</strong>
					<p>Parties can be rescheduled once if given a 10 day notice (subject to availability). If you would like to change your party package
						or start time, please give us a call or send an email to soulpoleworld@gmail.com at least 10 days before your party and we will try our best to accommodate the change.
						Changes cannot be made less than 10 days before the party because our resources have already been allocated. </p>
